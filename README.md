# Detection-of-Diabetic-Patients-Using-ECG-Signals
Developed a machine learning model using ECG data to detect diabetes with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes. Data preprocessing included normalization, filtering, and feature extraction. The Random Forest model achieved 87.5% precision, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven medical signal analysis for diagnostics.
